	<h3 class="w3-text-teal">About</h3>
	Incorporated in 2005, Sapeur Corp is lead by a team of entrepreneurial software industry executives from USA, Japan and
	Europe with a depth of experience at both start-ups and big companies.
	<p>
		Our big company experience taught us how to develop and market world class software products. Our small company
		experience taught us that most of those products are too complicated and expensive for many small business owners.
		That's why we decided to start Sapeur Corp.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are a privately funded small business like most of our customers and we expect to stay this way. 
		You can depend on us as a reliable, long-term business partner.
	</p>
