	payable. The charges will be equal to the current number of total User licenses requested times the User license fee
	currently in effect. You are responsible for paying for all User licenses ordered for the entire License Term, whether
	or not such User licenses are actively used. An authorized License Administrator may add licenses by using the Online
	Order form. Added licenses will be subject to the following: (i) added licenses will be coterminous
	with the preexisting License Term (either Initial Term or renewal term); (ii) the license fee for the added licenses
	will be the then current, generally applicable license fee. {$CFG.COMPANY} reserves the
	right to modify its fees and charges and to introduce new charges at any time, upon at least 30 days prior notice to

	basis. {$CFG.COMPANY}'s fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities,
	and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal
	or state) taxes based solely on {$CFG.COMPANY}'s income.<br />
